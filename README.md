This open source app for Live Location Sharing is built with [HyperTrack](https://www.hypertrack.com). Developers can now build live location sharing into their apps within minutes by using HyperTrack Live source code. For iOS, refer to our open source [iOS repository](https://github.com/hypertrack/live-app-ios).

[HyperTrack Live for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hypertrack.live) is available on the Google Play Store for use by users signed up with HyperTrack. [HyperTrack Live for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hypertrack-live/id1076924821) is available on the public App Store.

> 👋 Read our [blog post announcement](https://hypertrack.com/blog/2019/07/19/build-live-location-sharing-in-your-work-app-within-minutes/) to learn more about this sample app.

The app demonstrates a simple flow for users to share their live location with friends through their favorite messaging app when on the way to meet up. The convenient 23-character secure short-URL displays live location with accuracy, speed, bearing and recency. The view highlights the ongoing activity (walk, drive, stop, etc.). Device getting inactive due to permissions or other reasons, or disconnected due to unknown reasons is highlighted in the tracking experience. Battery charing and low battery states are flagged as well.

## Live Location Sharing
The primary feature of Hypertrack Live is Live Location Sharing. Live Location Sharing is useful for:
- Workforce productivity apps with messaging and customer support capabilities
- Peer-to-peer marketplaces for goods and services
- Ridesharing and carpooling apps
- Consumer apps like messengers and social apps

It helps solve the user's anxiety of “where are you⁉️”.
